# ServerClientChatAppJavaFX
A GUI supported JavaFX Chat Application

This project was developed as part of the “Computer Science Project” course. This is an “instant messaging” client-server application that enables users to communicate with each other on a text-based basis within a local network. Using the “JavaFX” framework and the SceneBuilder developed by Gluon, a graphical interface (GUI) was designed and developed for the server and client components. The application is based on the “Java Socket API” from Oracle®. The software for this application was developed in the integrated development environment “IntelliJ” from JetBrains. In the following section I would like to explain how the individual components work. This is followed by a technical insight into the frameworks used and classes developed. For better understanding, corresponding class diagrams have been included in the appendix of the document.
